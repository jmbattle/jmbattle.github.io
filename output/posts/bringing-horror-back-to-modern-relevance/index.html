<h2>Raised on Horror</h2>
<p>Growing up a quiet introvert, it's no surprise that I often found a certain escape from reality in the arms of books and movies.
Of particular interest to me were the genres of science fiction, fantasy, and horror.
To me, science fiction films inspired the future that could made possible with advanced technology and the promise of a better world, provided that we could engineer it, but could also serve as a stark warning of the dangers of the unknown or poorly understood.
Fantasy movies whisked me away to wondrous and fanciful lands, fostering an imagination for the seemingly impossible but always taking me along for an entertaining ride, with feats of practical effects wizardry that kept me guessing how it was done.
Then there was horror, which evoked the most primitive but firmly ingrained response of all, that of fear.  When fear takes hold, it leaves an indelible mark on a person, making such films comparatively more memorable than others.
The adrenaline rush, the pounding pulse, and the heightening anxiety all made for an enlivening experience every single time.
It was with horror movies that I always felt most alive and, through that, developed a continuing interest that would keep me drawn to them.
Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, Pinhead, and others would become storied figures to me, sinister killers that were the very epitome of evil but also the source of excitement that kept such movies so engaging.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="horror-goes-interactive">
<h2>Horror Goes Interactive</h2>
<p>This interest blossomed even further with the advent of this genre in video games, with titles such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill inspiring the same kind of fear except in a newly interactive manner.
Some of the scariest moments that I can recall were had wandering in the darkness of apartments in Silent Hill 2 with Pyramid Head's stalking presence or hiding in the Baker house in Resident Evil 7, trying to calm my nerves enough to proceed through the rest of the game without freaking the hell out.
As the years progressed, I have remained a loyal devotee to the most iconic of horror video game titles, everything from Dead Space to Resident Evil and Silent Hill and, more recently, The Last of Us series.
Now, with more immersive technologies such as VR being steadily improved and enjoying wider adoption, I continue to be optimistic about what lies ahead.</p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p>Despite most horror movies being relegated to dusty video rental store shelves for years, the horror genre finally had its heyday in the mid to late 90s, with slasher films such as Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer and ghost stories as the basis for movies such as the Ring and The Grudge gaining mainstream notoriety and helping to bolster the careers of their stars.
Some of these movies scared the pants off of me and, despite that, I always came back for more, eagerly awaiting the arrival of the next several films.
Sometime after high school, the trend began to die back down and the genre once again faded quietly into the background due to a combination of lazy, unoriginal scripts and the loss of the public's interest and attention.
Horror simply wasn't as edgy and cool anymore, resorting to the once tried-and-true formula of jump scares ad nauseum, which no longer seemed effective enough to conjure interest and desire to see such movies.
As a result, horror became a largely forgettable genre for nearly a decade, really until The Walking Dead premiered on AMC and jump-started a renewed interest in zombies.
Not having read the comic, I was instantly enthralled by that show and hopeful for a resurgence of the genre.
While it has done well since then, it has eventually become tired due to a drawn-out narrative with an abundance of dialogue yet a dearth of zombies.</p>
<p>That aside, nothing eventful has really happened in the world of horror movies in recent memory and the studios have been doing little to break the endless cycle of remakes, wholly unnecessary sequels, and painfully cliched stories.
Luckily, foreign studios took the reins and put out some refreshing takes on horror, notably Train to Busan, I Saw the Devil, and The Wailing, that tided me over for the last few years.
Even more recently, Andrés Muschietti reimagined the classic Stephen King novel It in two films, portraying Pennywise as a much greater malevolent and terrifying entity than it ever was in the 1990 adaptation, which interspersed comedic moments that compromised its scariness.</p>
<p>Horror had once again come to the forefront and gained some attention, albeit it only fleetingly. Still, it served as a fresh reminder of what effective horror could be when done right.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="deconstructing-great-horror">
<h2>Deconstructing Great Horror</h2>
<p>In order to understand how to advance the genre and put out celebrated horror movies in the future, we have to deconstruct what makes for good horror.
A great horror film is not necessarily predicated on copious amounts of gore and stylistic kills but, rather, it should tap into the atmospheric qualities themselves.
What's unseen but implied or difficult to see is much more effective at freaking us out than a series of jump scares.
Jump scares are nothing more than a cheap tactic, one that leverages the adrenaline response to instill a sense of dread in us.
Conversely, a slow buildup of unsettling occurrences leaves a much more lasting impression and an unceasing fear over the course of a movie.
Strange and disturbing sounds keep us on edge. Vaguely detectable presence or movement that is not the primary focus of a scene goes unexplained to the audience, sending chills up their spine.
Daylight does not serve as a reprieve from terror and, instead, offers a challenge to the writer and director in how to construct a scene that can scare us just as effectively.
Moreover, the audience should be kept ignorant to certain plot elements if it aids confusion, paranoia, and a desperation to survive the film.
If a horror movie leads us to pause or take frequent breaks, it's doing its job well and stands apart from the cookie-cutter formula that we've grown so accustomed to with the genre.</p>
<p>Basically, these movies have to manipulate the human sensory system at its core, using a series of subtle cues to collectively build the level of fear as the movie unfolds.
Creativity is thus more vital than prosthetics and makeup effects, jarring sounds, and buckets of blood.</p>

<div class="section" id="a-modern-approach-to-horror">
<h2>A Modern Approach to Horror</h2>
<p>Towards the end of my tenure working at Microsoft, a colleague mentioned some films named Hereditary and Midsommar, both from director Ari Aster.
Having some experience with the country, I immediately recalled the latter as one of their most cherished holidays, a day where Swedish folks partake in, to me at least, obscure rituals such as dancing around a pole and making decorative attire out of plants and flowers.
I found my inner skeptic taking hold as I wondered how such a benign and bubbly holiday could serve as the theme for a movie intended to scare the audience.
Both it and Hereditary sounded like some kind of lame B-movie attempts at horror, but I remained open to giving them a try when the opportunity presented itself.
Both films fell largely off of my radar until, lo' and behold, I found them prominently features on Amazon Prime.
What's more, I had recently joined Facebook and was able to test drive them with VR hardware, amplifying what was sure to already be an anxious experience.</p>
<div class="section" id="midsommar">
<h3>Midsommar</h3>
<div class="align-center figure align-left">
<img alt="" src="../../images/midsommar.png" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;">
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Let's start with my thoughts on Midsommar. As mentioned, the name of this film stems from a largely unfamiliar Swedish holiday filled with activities that are more aptly described as weird than scary.
Despite this, Ari Aster has managed to craft a film that combines elements of paganism and cultism with the antithetical and harmless backdrop of summer in the Swedish countryside, morphing what would generally be a mundane experience into something exceedingly disturbing.
While similar films like the Wicker Man offer a more conventional mystery than any take on horror, Midsommar successfully injects its own blend of depravity to show what would happen when pagan acts are taken to the extreme.
The story centers around a group of friends that accompany a foreign student back home to Hälsingland in Sweden for the Midsummer celebration only to learn that they've been delivered straight into the hands of a cult bent on sacrificing them to purge their own sins.
The first sign that something was horribly wrong was when they witnessed two old community members perform a ritual suicide known as Ättestupa, jumping to their deaths from a cliff high above several large rocks that added to the lethality.
Despite the visitors responding in shock, the villagers expressed little effect, dismissing it as customary.
As if this wasn't concerning enough, the villagers proceeded to mimic cries of agony from one of the surviving elders that had jumped, only to finish him off with a final blow by mallet.
The trauma of the scene, coupled with the bizarreness of the villager's responses, made for a deeply unsettling prelude, one that would eventally end in the demise of nearly all of the visitors.</p>
<p>As the story progresses, we're left mostly in the dark about what this cult wants with them and even at this point, whether they're legitimately a cult or just villagers with a misunderstood culture.
After two foreign witnesses to the Ättestupa attempt to leave, we learn of their mysterious disappearances and come to understand that the villagers won't allow them to do so, instead choosing to murder them to preserve the community's secrets.
We see them attempt to bewitch one of the foreigners using a love rune, his later disinhibition by way of a psychedelic tea, and deepening tensions between him and his girlfriend, eventually culminating in a mating ritual that she witnesses at its climax.
Finally, the girlfriend is crowned as the May Queen and turns on her former partner, assimilating into the cult's mentality and sacrificing him to immolation as her expression twists from terror to satisfaction.</p>
<p>The film is increasingly unsettling all the way through, dropping small clues about all not being right with the village they've found themselves stranded in.
While not particularly scary in the normal sense, it does adhere to the principle of not explaining everything and maintains a healthy level of discomfort and unease in the audience as we learn of each successive bizarre event, speculating about its ultimate meaning in terms of the villagers' motives.
Really the only moment in the entire film that relies on shock value is a close-up view of the elder's face when it's smashed with a mallet after the Ättestupa.
Such singular use is acceptable as long as it doesn't become a desperate crutch to maintain the scare factor.
Doing so would eventually desensitize the audience and become tiresome and less effective as they build a tolerance to a rehashed tactic.
The key is to keep things varied and the viewers guessing and fearful for what comes next.</p>
<p>In total, seeing this movie has skewed my predisposition towards Midsommar into an unpleasant one so I'd say the director has accomplished his goal.
Ari shows that, with enough creativity, even the most docile and benign setting can be turned into something unexpectedly terrifying and that future masters of horror should pay mind to new avenues of frightening moviegoers, away from the usual bloody spectacles on screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hereditary">
<h3>Hereditary</h3>
<div class="align-center figure align-left">
<img alt="" src="../../images/hereditary.png" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;">
</div>
<p></p>
<p>With Hereditary, we get one of the more inventive horror movies in the last couple of years that relies heavily on indirect and predominantly atmospheric scares.
The plot focuses on a family who suffers a tragic loss and gradually uncovers the secret behind their twisted lineage.</p>
<p>At the film's opening, a grandmother has passed away and we learn of the dysfunctional relationship between her and matriarch, Annie.
As the family struggles to move past the trauma of her death, they experience another sudden loss when an outing to attend a party leaves their 13-year-old daughter Charlie dead by decapitation after a swerve-and-miss, near wreck occurs at the hands of their son, Peter.
With her gone, some supernatural force is catalyzed, and we witness the family being increasingly psychologically tortured by some unknown entity.
Whether it's Charlie's spirit seeking revenge or something else is left unclear and open to interpretation, adding to the viewers' confusion.
Out of desperation, Annie seeks to commune with Charlie in a bid to cope with and move past her death, but the remaining family members are concerned she is losing grip on her sanity.
The situation quickly spirals out of control as they discover the grandmother's body has been placed in the attic along with nearby occultist symbols scrawled in blood.
Shortly after, the father bursts into flames when they attempt to burn Charlie's sketchbook, an object they believed was binding her to the home.
The madness only escalates further from there, with a possessed Annie trapping Peter in the attic before beheading herself while simultaneously levitating.</p>
<p>By the end, Peter becomes inhabited by a demon we come to learn is named Paimon, with a secret cult pulling the strings behind the scenes.
Piecing together the backstory, it becomes apparent that they worship him so that they can be the benefactors of his reign and rewarded for facilitaing it.
As for the grandmother, she was a cult member that was seeking a vessel for Paimon and was left with no choice but to use Charlie, despite his preference for a male host.
Then, with Charlie gone and through the machinations of the cult, he was finally able to possess Peter and rule over humanity.</p>
<p>Looking back, this is horror at its finest, mixing new techniques at scaring with sparing use of shock moments, striking a balance intended to leave you creeped out instead of inducing a cheap and easy adrenaline response.
I'll be the first to admit that several scenes in this movie were some of the eeriest I've ever come across.
There were moments where I would double- and triple-take because I weren't sure if I saw something in the darkness.
Adding to that, the odd behaviors of Charlie, most notably her tongue clicking sound, were used repeatedly as an aural irritant to leave the viewer erratic and unhinged.
Similar to Midsommar, albeit coming chronologically before it, Aster did rely on a singular shock moment, a close-up of Charlie's decapitated head covered with ants no less, to instantly frighten you but this was more the exception than the rule.</p>
<p>Having survived the viewing, I have to applaud this excellent work of horror that Ari has created with Hereditary.
The techniques employed here are masterful, especially with it being his first feature film and foray into the genre.</p>
<p>"So, what are these techniques?" you might say. In my mind, they are the following.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>He relied heavily on sound, sometimes subtle and other times irritating, to keep us on edge.</p></li>
<li><p>He planted creepy imagery all over the film, most often out of direct view. Again, increasing our paranoia through background imagery is more effective than plopping something scary in the center of the frame.</p></li>
<li><p>He left much of the events of the film unexplained until the very end. Keeping the audience from fully processing what is happening, especially where fear is concerned, is a surefire way to heighten panic.</p></li>
<li><p>He made the film less about the antagonist and instead chose to focus on the family's descent into madness. Watching them unravel was more effective than watching characters be killed off one by one in a formulaic manner.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This film was affecting to watch and really showed me how horror can be elevated into something that stands cinematically toe to toe with other classically great genres.
I still intend to go back for repeated viewings and I've no doubt there are numerous creepy easter eggs left to identify throughout the film.
The one that still gets me to this day is the creepy-as-hell cult member smiling in the darkness of the downstairs closet just before the conclusion of the movie.
That and the aftermath of the decapitation scene are sure to plague me in nightmares for years to come.</p>
