Well, where do I begin? My name is Jason and I'm a 37-year-old electrical engineer that specializes in electronics design for smart battery packs.
Originally a Floridian, I've gradually made my way across the country to Washington, by way of Texas and following a stint abroad in South Korea, and have been here since Fall 2017.
Professionally, I've worked everywhere from Texas Instruments to Samsung Electronics, Microsoft, and now Facebook.

As for hobbies, the most recent one in the last few years is rock climbing and the other one that's remained most consistent over my life is video gaming.
During college, I was big into music-writing and guitar-playing and even dove headfirst into forming a band and playing local gigs but, eventually, my career took over and I had to move on.
Though my instruments have long been collecting dust, I remain interested in recording and am considering new investments there to reinvigorate my creative side and provide a much-needed outlet away from the constant grind of working life.

Although this blog is coming into existence later in life, I figured, if nothing more, it could only benefit my waning writing skills so here we are.
I hope to grow this into a worthwhile site covering a range of topics, so please join me on the journey and let's see where it goes.
